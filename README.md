# Provisioning Configurations and Scripts

Repository contains scripts and configurations to provision new hosts.  

> Intended to be used for a one-shot configuration of the host and installation of applications.  
> For a better orchestrated and idempotent solution the [Ansible](https://github.com/dulfer/ansible) repository should be considered.
